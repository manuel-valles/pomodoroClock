# pomodoroClock

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, (In Italian the plural would be pomodori) after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
